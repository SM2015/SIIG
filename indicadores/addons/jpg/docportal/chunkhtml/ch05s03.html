                be forming. There is nothing that says that we have to create the same image using
                the same data every time the graph script is called. We could for example randomly
                select a pre-stored image in a directory and every time we call (the same) graph
                script and new image is returned. Hence, with PHP scripts we can create dynamic
                images that generate different images depending on some yet to be specified
                parameters even though the script name stays the same. This is a new behaviour
                compared with our normal images. </p><p>This could also lead to a new, and very real, problem which has to do with the
                local caching most browsers do in order to avoid re-fetching already fetched objects
                such as images. Normally a browser will check the time stamp on the file on the
                server and compare with the latest fetched version it has stored locally. If the
                browser sees that the file on the server is older than what it already has it will
                not re-fetch the file. </p><p>Since a dynamic image is produced by a script and the script will stay the same
                even if the produced image is changing (due to new data) the browser might still
                think that the image has not changed since the script is the same and will not
                bother re-fetching it again. The exact behavior of the browser cache is usually
                adjustable by the end user and hence out of control for us who writes the script. A
                simple way to always force the client to re-fetch the dynamic image is described in <a class="xref" href="ch05s05.html#sec2.forcing-browser-update" title="5.5.6. Forcing the browser to update your graph">Section 5.5.6</a></p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch05s02.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch05.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch05s04.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">5.2. What is an image? </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> 5.4. Dynamic images on the command line</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
